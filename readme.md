# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

*Alex Zhao | Jan 31, 2025*

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, understanding public sentiment—especially as expressed on social media—has become essential for businesses and organizations. This project demonstrates an end-to-end approach to analyzing and visualizing social media sentiment trends using a combination of Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and interactive dashboard tools.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of tweets related to six major U.S. airlines. The dataset, originally sourced from CrowdFlower’s "Data for Everyone" library, contains crowd-sourced sentiment labels (positive, neutral, or negative) along with detailed metadata for each tweet. By processing this real-world data, the project aims to uncover insights about public opinion, highlight trends over time, and provide an interactive means to explore sentiment dynamics.
